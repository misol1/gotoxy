1@BRIDGE@The old bridge creaks loud as you step out on it, adding to your excitement as you approach the Kallis front gate.\nSurrounding you to the east and west is the icy, dark ocean...@

2@BRIDGE II@Getting closer to your favourite shack, you realize with shame that you have not been here for over three weeks. Will it be the same? Will they all still be here, the legends and the happy enthusiasts of the wood-fire sauna? You pray to God they will...@

d@THE MAELSTROEM@You plunge deep into the freezing water, where the extreme chock to your body quickly overpowers you. You end your days as a wrinkly warrior in the same dark ocean that you loved... to death.@D

F@RECEPTION@Ah, you're inside\g21 It's warm and cozy in here, almost as if the eucalyptus steam travelled all the way from the sauna... It's good to be back\g21 The bathhouse entrance is to the north, next to the reception desk.@icP\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\r-------------------------------------\n\nThe receptionist screams in shock (or from pleasure?) as you enter the reception stark naked\g21 You are forced to retreat back into the bath house premises...\n\n\f0PATH OF GLORY I                     \n/icM3

3@PATH OF GLORY I@Inside\g21 Beautiful\g21\g21 Now it's just a few more steps... To the east is the path to the entrance, to the north you spot a few wrinkly, naked gentlemen getting ready for a bone-chilling swim.

4@PATH OF GLORY II@Aaah... Walking beneath a starry, black sky, you feel as if moved on by destiny to your final destination. The path continues to the east, while walking west will take you further away from the gates of paradise...@iHP\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\r-------------------------------------\n\nSuddenly, the grumpy man you just passed comes storming behind you, screaming 'NO SHOW TICKET\g21\g21 NO SHOW TICKET\g21 IGOR MASH\g21\g21' A second later, Igor rams you violently into the wall, and you lose consciousness...  \n\nYou wake up in the hospital a few days later, forever banned from Kallis...\nALL IS LOST :(/iHD

5@PATH OF GLORY III@This is it\g21\g21 The entrance door leading to lockers and hangers is to the north, where all your dreams will come true. You hope to see a lot of familiar faces in there...@U0

i@OUTDOOR RESTING SPOT@Three sauna enthusiasts are sitting on a bench, with steam from their slowly cooked bodies rising high into the sky. None of them seem terribly happy. You recognize one of them as the infamous 'eastern European man with a hat', the guy who insists on wearing a hat inside the sauna at all times.\nTo the north a door leads inside the bath house, to the west is the hole in the ice.@iHP\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\r-------------------------------------\n\nSuddenly, the grumpy man you just passed comes storming behind you, screaming 'NO SHOW TICKET\g21\g21 NO SHOW TICKET\g21 IGOR MASH\g21\g21' A second later, Igor rams you violently into the wall, and you lose consciousness...  \n\nYou wake up in the hospital a few days later, forever banned from Kallis...\nALL IS LOST :(/iHD

j@A HOLE IN THE ICE@There is nothing here except the stairs leading down to the hole and the water, a messy sludge of ice bricks and dark liquid. You take the first steps...@IcP\90\nPress a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nYou plunge into the ice water with your clothes still on, where the chock almost kills you straight away. When you retreat in panic, you stumble on the stairs, fall on the side, and hit your head on the ice...\n\nLater, in the hospital, you learn that you have been banned from Kallis for your stupid behaviour - forever.../IcD/I1iyi2Ry/ici1Mi/ici1P\nYou make it about halfway down the stairs into the water before you give up... diving into this hellish frozen sludge unprepared will kill you\g21\n\n\f0OUTDOOR RESTING SPOT                     \n/icI1i2P\nAll hot and steamy from the sauna, you make a big splash, even to the point of dipping your head in the water. \nSuddenly, a strange mirage appears before your eyes, a waving, snakelike yellow thing, something stuck on the bottom of the ocean, a deep dwelling, long forgotten treasure.../I1iyG2/cj0

c@LOCKERS@Surprisingly, the locker room is eerily quiet and empty. In addition to that, only a handful of the lockers are in use... What the hell? What happened to the friendly banter, the eyes brimming with enthusiasm for the dive into the steam? Three weeks in hiatus and this is what you get\g21? It's no good, I tell you...@G0

s@SHOWERS@Hygiene is terribly important, and those who agree with you typically come here to rinse off the dirt from their poor selves before heading into the saunas. Today though, the showers are eerily empty, with just a single bar of soap on the floor indicating any kind of recent human presence. What's worse, there's yellow security tape all over the shower heads, saying 'OUT OF ORDER\g21'@

t@TOWEL HANGERS@As the name of this room suggests, people come here to hang their towels. As the parser of this system doesn't yet handle dropping things off, you might as well just forget about that... The showers are to the east, the water sprinkler to the west.@

w@WATER SPRINKLER@When dehydration hits, you come here to replenish yourself... But?... You freeze in your tracks, as if struck by lightning\g21 Somebody has REMOVED the 'Sauna Heroes 2013' board from the wall, where you photo was forever a part of Kallis proud legacy... until now... WTF\g21?\g21 The rage inside you is blinding, your face tomato red in pure disgust\g21\nSaunas are to the north, maybe that'll help, or try heading for the lying bench to the west.@

b@THE BENCH OF GREAT LIES@A bunch of sour-looking hairy guys are sitting on the bench, none of them talking. They stare awkwardly at you as you approach...\nSomething terrible is going on here, something killing the mood, something even more foul than the most potent fart ever to have been discharged in this place...\nPerhaps some fresh air (to the south), or a sip of water from the sprinkler (to the east) would do you well?@@IcP\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nAs soon as you enter the premises - fully clothed - a bearded guard shows up and throws you out the door\g21\n\n'Get out of here, idiot\g21'\n\n\f0OUTDOOR RESTING SPOT                     \n/IcMi

h@SAUNA HALLWAY@The anguish that's been building up while noticing the unwelcome changes to this place seems to slowly fade away as you step down the hallway. Finally sitting down with your brothers-in-arms, all of the bad things are going to evaporate, like thinly veiled steam from a bad dream...@

H@OUTSIDE SAUNAS@Still standing in the hallway, you've got the eucalyptus facilities to the west, while the mixed gender sauna lies to the east. As always, the choice is an extremely difficult one.@U6/E-b

e@EUCALYPTUS SAUNA@The room is empty... Somehow, it has never been quite the same since the turtle man was stopped from doing what he loved most of all... spreading eucalyptus oil all over the place and steaming it up like a real G\g21 \nOn the positive side, it's scorching hot in here - nice...@

S@SHARED SAUNA@It's the usual mix - about 20 men for each woman - with the first group staring eagerly at the second. As always, being in here feels awkward and oddly uplifting at the same time. \nTo the west is the sauna hallway, to the east is the female section of Kallis - but only a complete idiot would dare to venture in there\g21@

l@LADIES QUARTERS@You almost faint immediately as you set foot in here, being surrounded by exposed female flesh in every direction you look. What on earth were you thinking, you fool\g21?\g21? It would be extremely wise to return west to the shared sauna, but should you have an exceptionally strong death wish, the path does continue east.@I4I7iLS2/I4I7iLP\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nYour clever disguise is working\g21\g21 ... though you hear some nasty comments behind your back...\n\n'Yeah, SURE she's got a beautiful face, but look at those broad shoulders...'\n\nLuckily, they seem to have missed your beard.../I4I7GL/I7i4P\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nThe lipstick works - for about 5 seconds... then a woman starts to scream like an absolute maniac\g21 You run in terror back into the safety of the shared sauna...\n\n\f0SHARED SAUNA                     \n/I7i4MS/I4i7P\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nEverything seems to work smoothly first, and the women stare in awe at your curly locks... oh, the pride\g21\n\nThen, suddenly, a woman starts to scream like an absolute maniac and points at the pale, manly lips above your Karl Marx beard\g21\n\nYou run in terror back into the safety of the shared sauna...\n\n\f0SHARED SAUNA                     \n/I4i7MS/i7i4P\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nIt takes about a microsecond before you are spotted, and only seconds later you are wrestled to the ground and hit in the face. Sure, it's nice to be underneath all this female flesh, but not when it's smothering you to death...\nWhich, unfortunately, it does... \n\nWhat a way to go though\g21\g21/i7i4D

m@THE JUNCTION@With wrinkly females bumping against you from all sides you find it extremely hard to concentrate, but even in your state of shock and confusion you notice the path splitting into one leading east and one going south. Oddly, the door heading south has a sign above it saying 'E.J. Dungeon - trespassers will be wrestled to the ground, and, quite possibly, raped'.@IkE4M/IkE1J/Iki,P\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nOut of the misty sauna steam to the west, a dark and evil-looking figure suddenly steps out, staring intensely at you with cloudy eyes. He doesn't really look familiar... or?\n\n'So...', says a snake-like, hissing voice, you don't even recognize me? ... The man you refused, the man who was not good enough for 'The sauna-club... for us guys'...'\n\nHe spits vengefully on the floor and continues.\n\n'I turned up for your 'test', wearing a yellow life jacket at Klaffbron in Malmo in the middle of the night.. only to realize I had been tricked\g21... It was the most humiliating moment of my life...'\n\n'So... you might not remember ESMAIL JAMSHIDI... but I have corrupted your precious bath house, kidnapped your pathetic turtle man, and spread hatred everywhere... you will never forget my name.. again\g21\g21'\n\nEvil Esmail laughs uncontrollably... The sound fills you with dread...\n/IkG,@IkPNononoooo noooooooo\g21\g21\g21\n\nSeconds later, Manolo rips you both to shreds and feasts on your guts.../IkD

n@ESMAIL'S DUNGEON@What in the Devil's name is this place?? Have you gone insane?? The room is all dark, with a single red spotlight in the ceiling shining a light on the only person in the room - a hunchbacked, naked old man on his back, tied with ropes to a strange-looking black altar. \nIt's... no...? It can't be... BUT YES\g21\g21 It's the turtle man himself, the lost sheep\g21? IT'S KENT\g21\g21 What have they DONE???@ @IkPNononoooo noooooooo\g21\g21\g21\n\nSeconds later, Manolo rips you both to shreds and feasts on your guts.../IkD

p@LADIES HALLWAY@You're more or less trampled in here, as the hallway is absolutely jam packed with T&A storming towards you in what appears to be your own private Sodom and Gomorrah. Pressing your back against the wall, you desperately make your way east.@IkPThe stomping boots of MANOLO follow closely in your tracks.../IkE2M@IkPNononoooo noooooooo\g21\g21\g21\n\nSeconds later, Manolo rips you both to shreds and feasts on your guts.../IkD

q@DEAD END@As soon as you enter, you realize coming here was a mistake\g21 There is nothing in the room except white walls in all directions\g21\g21@IkPTrembling with fear, you hear the roar of guard dog MANOLO behind you, getting ever closer to putting his teeth into you.../IkE3M@IkPNononoooo noooooooo\g21\g21\g21\n\nSeconds later, Manolo rips you both to shreds and feasts on your guts.../IkD
