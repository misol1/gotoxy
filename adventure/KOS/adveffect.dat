F@O@You grab the handle and prepare to enter the hall of sauna gods, but... the door won't budge\g21 What the??? Is it possible... can it be...? ...Closed? A chilling sensation sweeps through your body, followed by a great longing...@
F@k@After several knocks, an old man sticks his head out. \n\b0'Howdy young man, I could have sworn this was my bathroom? Or? Where are my slippers? Hilda\g21\g21'\r \nAs he turns around to leave, you swiftly grab the door.@Xf/S1
F@A@No matter how much you punish it, the # will not open this way...

c@r@ @Uc/Rc/EBv/PYou slip out of your uniform and into your birthday suit... Aah...\n\nThe bearded gangster steps out of the room for now. \n\n'I'm still watching you, birdbrain\g21 Also, I hope you didn't forget to do the flamenco for little Miss Receptionist out there...'@ @IcPHere?? Now hold on there, Buster Keaton.../icPYou are already naked, you fool\g21
c@T@ @R/Gc/EvB/PThe bearded badass pops up again as soon as your clothes are back on, eyeing you suspiciously...

f@2@Yeah it's tempting, I get it... Think of wife, think of kids, for Gods sake\g21\g21 Now keep your focus on those wrinkly old men... that's the good stuff... 
f@1@The # hands you the ticket with a blink.\n\n\b0'Have fun in there hun, and don't forget to let Igor have a look at this...'\n'Oh, also, do you need a sitting pad for the sauna?'\n\n'Hmm, I guess...'\r, you reply, \b0'but I'm out of cash now...'\n\n'Oooh...  then you'll have to amuse me in some way to get it...'@GT/Um@ @ITPYou're out of money again, Shaggy.../iTPNow where on earth did I put that money???
f@t@\b0'Heeey, it was a while ago since I saw you... Actually, a few things have changed around here lately, but me, I'm still the same... always here, waiting patiently for you...'
f@4@\nSmiling wryly, you say: \n\b0A guy tells his doctor: 'I feel like a pig...'\n'How long have you felt like this?' the doctor asks.\n'Since last WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK\g21\g21'\r\n\nUnapprovingly, the # shakes her head.\n\b0'Come on, that the best you got? Let's see some moves, handsome\g21'@i_S1/G_
f@3@Your snake-like, wavy movements quickly sends the receptionist into a laughing fit. \b0\n'Okay, okay', you win\g21\g21' Here's your little pad for your little butt...'\r\nShe hands you the small towel with a big grin.@isS1/Gs@\b0'Harhar, that looks funny\g21\g21 ..but why on earth are you doing that?'\r

g@t@The # grumbles and spits and refuses to speak with, or even look at you\g21 How rude\g21\g21
g@5@The man inspects your ticket closely, and makes a few grunting noises. Finally, he nods his head slightly and ignores you once more.@iHS1/GH@You don't have no tickets, mister...

t@E@ @ihP\90Cleverly hidden in the fold, you find 50 Swedish crowns stashed away - enough for a ticket\g21 You take it.../ihGm/Gh

B@t@The guard looks down on you with a blank stare:\n\n'You're not getting in here looking like that, dumb-ass...'

v@A@Why in the world would you want to do that to your trusty old friend? Besides, what object around here would be suitable to kill him?
v@t@\nDavid suddenly turns quite serious, and you feel his pain as his words enter your eardrums:\n\n'It's not the same... not the same, my friend... Kent has vanished you see, he has not been seen at Kallis for weeks... and the new E.J. guards around here are horrible, just horrible...'\n\n'But atleast today I went in the water almost up to my waist', he grins in an attempt to cheer things up a bit. That, too, fails miserably.

a@t@'Changes? In here? It's all the same to me, man...\n\nBesides, I always sit here, in the... ... mixed sauna... It's just so much... cosier...\n\nUh, Kent? I haven't seen that wrinkly toad in a while. Can't say I mind much...'
a@A@Why in the world would you want to do that to your trusty old friend? Besides, what object around here would be suitable to kill him?

n@E@ @inPThe naked old men are in the way of your exploration.../InPInside the tube you find a rolled-up, battered note written on a piece of toilet paper. You take it./InG8/InUn
n@T@It's a struggle, getting down on the floor and awkwardly crawling around below all those crusty, foul-smelling feet, but finally you manage to grab the plastic tube and return to a standing position. The men are staring at you in disbelief...@R/Gn

l@7@O-key... Your lips are now coloured bright green... I don't know, man, but hey, if that's your thing...@G7

b@6@You eagerly get seated on your sitting pad at the uppermost level of the bench - time to cook it up\g21@G6/R-@You sit down on your bare buttocks... unwisely...\n\nWithin seconds, two enormous guards drag you screaming out of the sauna, saying 'We saw you on the surveillance cam, grease-monkey\g21 No sitting pad, huh?? You people just never learn...'\n\nThis is the last time you ever set foot in Kallis, thanks to your new lifetime ban...@D

w@78@M-hmmm... *you start whistling the Lumberjack song* ... \n\nThat wig is beautiful on you, girl\g21\g21@G4

e@t@'There I was...', he says, 'in the midst of a bloody war, up to my chest in dead bodies, fighting those brutes with my bare knuckles and...'\n\nHe suddenly stops.\n\n'...for what? Now Kent is gone, and lowlifes like E.J. set the rules around here... What is the point of anything???'\n\nAfter this somewhat bizarre speech, the # refuses to say anything more. Who the hell is E.J?

y@T@With a last, desperate effort you manage to sink deep enough into the deadly black liquid to sweep your arm along the sea floor and grab what's there\g21 Once you reach the surface again, shaking in the freezing cold, you stare in disbelief at what seems to be... a blonde, female wig\g21@R/Gw/S2@ @PNo way, my friend... it's just too deep, too dark, too cold... you'll kill yourself trying... Maybe if you were extremely hot...

k@9@It takes several minutes to untie the old legend, during which you keep looking over your shoulder for something terrible to turn up... Finally the turtle man is free, but he's still knocked out.@iAS1/GA
k@T@Legendary turtleman Kent is not some object to be carried around in your sweaty palm, mind you\g21 Show some respect for the Master - use correct verbs\g21
k@0@Fitting you perfectly like a ninja turtle backpack, you lift Kent up on your back. Immediately afterwards, you look down at the altar and realize that the old man has been lying on top of the 2013 Sauna Heroes board all this time... insensitive bastards\g21\g21 Disgusted, you grab the board.\n\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nSuddenly, the whole room shakes as a mighty voice resounds around you... it's calling for the beast... it's calling for ...\n\n'MANOLO\g21\g21'\n\nOut of the shadows to the south steps this once friendly, but now completely mad-looking pizza bakery assistant... He's foaming at the mouth... thirsty for blood\g21 @R4/G9/Gk/EQM@But he's like... tied up, you know?

M@t@Manolo is grunting, he's hissing, he's making ugly faces... the conversation really isn't going anywhere...
M@A@Umm, ok... so you want to attack this rabies-infested, red-eyed bulldog of a man while Kent is hanging on your back? Ok...\n\nSeconds later, Manolo rips you both to shreds and feasts on your guts...@D

J@t@'No my friend... we have talked more than enough...'\n\n'GET THEM, MY HELLHOUND\g21\g21'\n\nMadman Manolo is closing in on you\g21
J@A@Esmail is skinny and fragile, true, but you seem to have forgotten about the half-beast, half-man... Manolo\g21\n\nDesperately, you swing the turtle man's legs around and manage to hit Esmail underneath the chin, but only seconds later the crazy pizza assistant jumps on your back and starts tearing the flesh from your very body... it's a violent, gruesome death\g21@D

E@F@\nWith certain death approaching you from behind, the search for an exit is desperate, frantic... but you uncover nothing\g21 Panic is rising, rising... and then...\n\n\90Press a key to continue...\K\p0;k;\b0-------------------------------------\n\nOut of nowhere... a miracle occurs...\n\nAn old, wrinkly arm is raised behind your back, then a trembling hand, and a bone-white index finger... There is life in the old turtle man still\g21 With his last powers, he is pointing you to the right spot\g21\g21\n\nThe hidden exit is right there, and now it's open\g21@S1/EEx@You search frantically, but find nothing... maybe you misunderstood something?@

#e@W@ @i6PYou need to get seated first.../I6cj+/I6vj=1PHoly crap this is good... pores opening up, sweat pouring down... you're alive again\g21/I6i1vj=1G1/I6vj=2POooh, you're really starting to steam up, almost to the point of feeling uncomfortable... but you know you can take a bit more, just a little more.../I6vj=3PThere is no mirror in here, but you're pretty sure you've got the lobster look, plus it's getting hard to breathe... time to call it quits?/I6vj=4PThis is getting extreme, you have never pushed yourself this hard before... what the hell are you doing? Your internal organs are starting to give up, you twist and turn in agony and pain, your skin is hot enough to fry bacon...\g21/I6vj=5PYou're delirious now, to the point of forgetting who you are and why you came here... there is not an ounce of water left in your body, your throat is burning like the Sahara, your forehead is pounding relentlessly - you need to get out\g21/I6vj=6PYou reach an almost Nirvana-like state, where nothing exists outside of you and the steam becomes part of your very being... for a few seconds you are sure of being the next Enlightened One... Unfortunately, and to your utter disappointment, your heart collapses just a moment after, and you tumble down to the sweat-stained floor below.../I6vj=6D/I6i3vj=5G3
